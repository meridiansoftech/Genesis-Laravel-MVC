Hey there everyone,

Welcome to the Genesis for Laravel MVC project. This project is meant to give you a starting point for the MVC structure of your next Laravel app.

You are invited to make a contribution to code and documentation of this package.

## Git

The project is currently running 3 major git branches: master, 5.x and 6.x branches. If you would like to contribute, you need to know into which branch your contributions should fall.

### master Branch

This branch contains the latest stable code updates for Laravel 5.x versions (not Laravel 4.x !). It should have stable code merged from the 5.x branch.

### 5.x Branch

This branch is for boilerplate MVC structure of Laravel apps of versions _5.*_. Beware, it contains experimental code. For stable code, see the master branch.

### 4.x Branch

This branch also contains boilerplate MVC structure of Laravel apps, but for versions _4.*_. It should contain stable code merged from other test branches.

To test experimental code for the 4.x branch, simply create a new git branch named accordingly _(e.g. a 'view-templates' branch)_. When tests are done, and the code is merged, this branch should be deleted.
